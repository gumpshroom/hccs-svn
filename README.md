hccs2da.ash: stable automation script, run this after perming skills and before diet or spending adv. Optional: BAFH whitelist for auto consult.

hccs2daexp.ash: better but untested alternative automation script, EXPERIMENTAL AND UNTESTED, supports more IOTM. RUN "hccs2daexp help" IN CLI FOR INFO

hccs.ccs: custom combat script for main script, should be automatically used as long as the ccs is installed by placing in css folder.
(You need disintegrate, stuffed mortar shell and curse of weaksauce to use this css without modification, soul saucery is recommmanded if you have scaling IotM monsters.)

postCS.ash: in alpha state, run in CS aftercore to attempt finishing your aftercore, needs a lot of fixing before it is fit for the general public

Required IOTM: 

VIP key, Genie Bottle ONLY!!

Required other stuff: 

Stuffed mortar shell and Curse of weaksauce for CSS, but you can modify it easily.

Read www.reddit.com/r/kol/wiki/guides/iloath_hccs if you have clip arts

You just need some perm, but more increase your chances.

Read www.reddit.com/r/kol/wiki/guides/iloath_hccs2 if you dont

You need more perms, some item%, as well as oven(cheap), Peppermint Rhino(technically optional, but cheap and reduce fail chance) and Salsa de las Epocas recipe(you get it eventually with VIP)

If you have IoTM with scaling monsters, you might want more skills like itchy finger and either saucestorm or saucegeyser.

(Partially) Supported IOTM:

Cosplay Saber, Clip Arts, Kramco Sausage-o-Matic, Neverending Party, Bastille Battalion, BoomBox, God Lobster, LOV tunnels, Boxing Daycare, Voter Registration, FantasyRealm, January's Garbage Tote, pantogram, Pocket Meteor Guide, Kremlin's Greatest Briefcase, li'l orphan tot, Stomping Boots, Doctor Bag, pen pal
