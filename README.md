hccs2da.ash: main automation script, run this after ascending/rollover and preparation.

counterskip.ash: st this as your counter script, it prevent kolmafia from aborting upon hitting a semirare counter in CS runs (there is probably a better way of doing this)

hccs.ccs: custom combat script for main script, should be automatically used as long as the ccs is installed.
