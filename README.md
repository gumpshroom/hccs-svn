hccs2da.ash: main automation script, run this after ascending/rollover. Optional: BAFH whitelist for auto consult.

counterskip.ash: place this in your script folder, it prevent kolmafia from aborting upon hitting a semirare counter in CS runs (there is probably a better way of doing this)

hccs.ccs: custom combat script for main script, should be automatically used as long as the ccs is installed by placing in css folder.
(You need disintegrate, stuffed mortar shell and curse of weaksauce to use this css without modification.)

postCS.ash: in alpha state, run in CS aftercore to attempt finishing your aftercore, needs a lot of fixing before it is fit for the general public
