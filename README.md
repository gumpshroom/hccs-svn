counterskip.ash: place this in your script folder, it prevent kolmafia from aborting upon hitting a semirare counter in CS runs (there is probably a better way of doing this)

hccs.ccs: custom combat script for main script, should be automatically used as long as the ccs is installed by placing in css folder.
